I have included five screen shots of three devices:

- Nokia N9 (480x854)
- iPad Pro (1024x1366)
- MacBook Air (1440x900)

I used the [Responsively](https://opencollective.com/responsively) app while coding. They have a great screen-shot function. I also used [Photoscape app](http://www.photoscape.org/ps/main/index.php) to edit and combine the screen shots.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - I love using SASS!

### What I learned

I learned that sometimes less is more and that I needed to trust CSS Grid and Flexbox for positioning my layout.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.client {
	display: grid;
	margin: 3rem 1rem;
	padding-bottom: 1rem;

	@media screen and (min-width: $bp-xl-screen-end) {
		padding: 1rem;
	}

	&-image {
		margin: 2rem auto;
		border-radius: 50%;
		width: 7.5rem;
		@media screen and (min-width: $bp-xl-screen-end) {
			margin: 3rem auto;
		}
	}

	p {
		font-size: 1.5rem;
		line-height: 1.5em;
		color: $color-very-dk-grayish-blue;
		max-width: 35rem;
		margin: auto;
		//padding: 2rem;
	}

	h2 {
		font-size: 1.45em;
		margin-top: 6rem;
	}

	.position {
		margin-top: 1rem;
		padding: 0.5rem;
		font-size: 1.2rem;
	}
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
	console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```
