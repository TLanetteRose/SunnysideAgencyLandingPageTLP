I have included five screen shots of three devices:

- Nokia N9 (480x854)
- iPad Pro (1024x1366)
- MacBook Air (1440x900)

I used the [Responsively](https://opencollective.com/responsively) app while coding. They have a great screen-shot function. I also used [Photoscape app](http://www.photoscape.org/ps/main/index.php) to edit and combine the screen shots.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - I love using SASS!

### What I learned

I learned that sometimes less is more and that I needed to trust CSS Grid and Flexbox for positioning my layout. I tend to rely on padding and margin to place elements. I need to practice internalizing positions (absolute and relative) and trusting the power of Grid and Flexbox. I also found an example of how to change the hover color for icons. I used invert color before with an svg. This was useful with an image. I included the code snippet below:

```css
img:hover {
	filter: brightness(0) invert(1);
}
```

### Continued development

Position, position, position. That will always be me area for development. I always get caught up in placement and how to organize my page elements. This project was great for reinforcing CSS Grid and Flexbox.

### Useful resources
