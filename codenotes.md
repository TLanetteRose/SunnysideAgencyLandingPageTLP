# Welcome to My Code Notes

First day of working on the Sunnyside Agency Landing page. I have added the project files to my repository and added the Sass files. I am refering to Kitty Giraudel's Sass Boilerplate Github repository to organize my files. I didn't add a Theme folder because this is a simple one-page design. I'm also using Figma to refer to the design instead of Sketch. Update: I decided to use Sketch. I prefer the layout.

Started by changing the images used for the testimonial section. I wanted to see people that looked like me. I used Pixabay for my images. My new testimonial characters are Winston Goodman, Ulyssa Walton, and Serifina Burks. I feel good about changing the images.

Back again. Today I'm setting up the grid for the page. I've made five sections with the main content section becoming an inner grid. I'm using a grid-generator to help... Decided to only use grid on the gallery section. 

I used an image color picker to add background color to sections that had images. I added left and right padding to leave spaces on the edge of the page. This way the background will extend to the outsides.
