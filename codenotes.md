# Welcome to My Code Notes

### 10/27/2021

First day of working on the Sunnyside Agency Landing page. I have added the project files to my repository and added the Sass files. I am refering to Kitty Giraudel's Sass Boilerplate Github repository to organize my files. I didn't add a Theme folder because this is a simple one-page design. I'm also using Figma to refer to the design instead of Sketch.
